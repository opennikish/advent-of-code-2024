### Setup

```
export GO111MODULE=off
```

If outside of `$GOPATH/src`:
```
ln -s ~/projects/adventofcode2024 ~/go/src/adventofcode2024
```

### Run tests

Since we don't have go modules here we can run the tests like this:
```
 go test 1.go 1_test.go
```

### Notes

Each solution is a self-contained program, so duplication between them is fine.
Only one small exception (as an experiment) is a lib package with a few functions.
